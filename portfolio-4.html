					<h2>Macro Photography/Poster design</h2>
					<p>I had to design a Printed Advertisment for an Arts Event to be held in an Irish venue of my choice on 1st June of 2013. I could choose any exhibition/event
					that would be catagorised under "The Arts", and it could be real or ficitonal. The final solution had to be largely photograhic and typographic in design,
					although simple shapes/patterns/colours could also be added in Illustrator. The photography may have been manipulated if I wanted. The final advertisment had to 
					embody a visual that communicates appropriately the advertised Arts event.
